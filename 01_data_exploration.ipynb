    "The data was initially filtered using **class-specific thresholds** to manage length variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Custom Thresholds:** Applied class-specific thresholds for length.\n",
    "* **No Upper Bound for Legal:** No upper length bound was set for the legal documents to preserve the integrity of the full contract texts.\n",
    "* **Caps Applied:** Length caps were applied to other classes (e.g., emails and abstracts).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Dataset Balancing\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate the effects of class imbalance, the final dataset was balanced:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Capping by Smallest Class:** Each document class was later capped at **509 documents**.\n",
    "* This count **matches the sample volume** of the smallest class (`LEGAL_DOCUMENT`), ensuring the model trains on an equal number of samples from all four types."

      "Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. Especially if you have to prepare a presentation. I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. My suggestion for where to go is Austin. Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's. Flying somewhere takes too much time.\n",

      "Calculation of prompt diphoton production cross sections at Tevatron and LHC energies. A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is presented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark, gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of\n",

      "Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions. We describe a new algorithm, the $(k,\\ell)$-pebble game with colors, and use it obtain a characterization of the family of $(k,\\ell)$-sparse graphs and algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concerning tree decompositions of graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have received increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored pebbles generalize and strengthen the previous results of Lee and Streinu and give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. We also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the $(k,\\ell)$-pebble game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between pebble game algorithms and previous sparse graph algorithms by Gabow, \n",

      "The evolution of the Earth-Moon system based on the dark matter field fluid model. The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field fluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5 billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from Earth-Moon system data is \n",
