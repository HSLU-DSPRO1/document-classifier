    "    \"This case is about an apprenticeship test that had a disparate impact on Black apprenticeship applicants. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed this lawsuit on December 27, 2004, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Filing on behalf of thirteen Black individuals and a class of similarly situated Black apprenticeship test takers, the EEOC alleged that the individuals’ employer, the Ford Motor Company, as well as their union, the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural implement workers of America (the “UAW”), and the Ford-UAW Joint Apprenticeship Committee, violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and Michigan state anti-discrimination law. At issue were the selection tests for apprenticeship training programs, whose disparate impact denied Black applicants eligibility and admission. The EEOC sought injunctive relief, as well as damages (including backpay) for the Black apprenticeship applicants. The case was assigned to Judge Susan J. Dlott.\",\n",
